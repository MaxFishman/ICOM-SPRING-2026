Creative Computing at California Institute of the Arts is a forward-thinking interdisciplinary program that fuses the power of computational engineering skills with the limitless possibilities of artistic expression. This innovative degree encourages students to explore the intersection of technology and creativity, using computational tools to craft work that is both personally and culturally meaningful, while preparing them for industry. Our program is designed to provide an integrative learning experience that equips students with the skills to push the boundaries of art, music, and technology. With a strong foundation in computer science, electrical engineering, signal processing, and emerging technologies including virtual/augmented reality, robotics, and machine learning, students will be empowered to innovate, experiment, and reimagine what technology can do in artistic contexts.

## Homework

1. Choose three websites to explore. These can be websites for businesses, organizations, or personal blogs. Spend at least 5 minutes on each website, taking note of the elements that you like and dislike. Consider the following questions as you explore:
   - What is the overall design of the website? Is it visually appealing?
   - Is the navigation intuitive? Can you find what you're looking for easily?
   - Is the content organized in a logical way? Is it easy to read and understand?
   - Are there any interactive elements, such as forms, videos, or games?
   - Is the website responsive, meaning does it adjust to the size of the screen it is being viewed on?

2. After exploring each website, write a short summary analyzing the elements you liked and disliked, and explaining why. Be sure to include specific examples from the websites to support your analysis.
