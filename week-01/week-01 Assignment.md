## Homework

Choose **three** websites to explore. These can be websites for businesses, organizations, or personal blogs. Spend at least 5 minutes on each website, taking note of the elements that you like and dislike. Consider the following questions as you explore:

What is the overall design of the website? Is it visually appealing?
Is the navigation intuitive? Can you find what you're looking for easily?
Is the content organized in a logical way? Is it easy to read and understand?
Are there any interactive elements, such as forms, videos, or games?
Is the website responsive, meaning does it adjust to the size of the screen it is being viewed on?

### After exploring each website, write a short summary analyzing the elements you liked and disliked, and explaining why. Be sure to include specific examples and links from the websites to support your analysis.
