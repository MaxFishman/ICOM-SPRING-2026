## Student Learning Outcomes

- Students will learn the tools and technologies behind modern front end web development.
- Students will gain the skills needed to represent themselves and their practice through their website and web applications.
- Students will improve their computer science fundamentals by learning how to use the command line (terminal) and the developer tools built into it.

## Materials

### Equipment
- A computer with internet access

### Software
We will install these together as the course progresses:
- A programming focused text editor of your choice (I recommend VSCode, Atom, or Sublime Text)
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge)

### Expected Expenses
Purchasing a domain name to use as your website URL is an optional, but strongly encouraged part of this course. Domain name costs vary depending on TLD (.com, .me, .party, .art, etc) and some other factors, but most personal website domains come in at about $12 per year.

Creative Computing at California Institute of the Arts is a forward-thinking interdisciplinary program that fuses the power of computational engineering skills with the limitless possibilities of artistic expression. This innovative degree encourages students to explore the intersection of technology and creativity, using computational tools to craft work that is both personally and culturally meaningful, while preparing them for industry. Our program is designed to provide an integrative learning experience that equips students with the skills to push the boundaries of art, music, and technology. With a strong foundation in computer science, electrical engineering, signal processing, and emerging technologies including virtual/augmented reality, robotics, and machine learning, students will be empowered to innovate, experiment, and reimagine what technology can do in artistic contexts.
